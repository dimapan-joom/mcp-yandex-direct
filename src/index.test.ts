 * the client. So this spawns the REAL entry point over stdio and does a real MCP
 * handshake with the official SDK client (the same setup as docs/demo/run.mjs).
 *
 * Source, not dist/: `npm test` does not build, so asserting against dist would
 * silently grade a stale bundle. tsx is already the runner for these tests.
